# Basic Installation Test file
This Terraform file is to ensure that your local terraform installation is up and running.

The file structure and coding conventions should not be followed. It is horrible practice for a couple of reasons
1. All variables should be abstracted out into a variables.tf file and their placeholders should be placed in the main.tf file.
2. The provider should be stored in a seperate provider.tf file.

Once you have followed the guide [here](https://github.com/cyber-panther/breaking-captcha/blob/main/Teams_T2_2022/Cloud_Dev/onboarding/README.md) then ensure that you destory your resources so that it will work for everyone.
